# Capturing Voice Data

This example extracts the inâ€‘game voice chat from a demo and saves the raw audio
payloads to disk. Run it from the repository root:

```bash
cargo run --example voice_capture -- -demo <path/to/demo.dem> -out voice.raw
```

The written file contains the encoded voice stream. Converting the audio to a
playable format depends on the game and may require external tools. More details
