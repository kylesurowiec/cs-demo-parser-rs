# Examples

The previous Go examples have been removed. For working examples written in Rust see [`examples`](../examples).

Additional documentation for individual examples can be found in the subfolders, e.g. [net-messages](net-messages) or [encrypted-net-messages](encrypted-net-messages).

:information_source: Example code may not be production readyâ€”error handling is simplified and should not be used in critical systems as-is.
