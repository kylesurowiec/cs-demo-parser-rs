# Collect Kills Example Tasks

The following checklist tracks remaining work to display player nicknames in the `collect_kills` example.

- [x] Ensure the demo's `userinfo` string table is parsed so player names map to user IDs.
- [x] Verify the parser handles Source 1 string tables, updating the simple implementation if needed.
- [x] After names populate `GameState`, modify `collect_kills.rs` to show them in kill logs and the scoreboard.
- [x] Add debug logging to trace parsing and confirm names are available.
- [x] Re-run `collect_kills` until the output lists `Flusha: 20 kills`.
